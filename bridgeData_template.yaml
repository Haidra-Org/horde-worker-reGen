# Models to use.
# Instead of a model name, you may use any of the following magic constants:
#   "ALL" - Load all possible models (over 1TB of space).
#   "TOP n" - Load the top "N" most popular models (e.g., "top 5").
#   "BOTTOM n" - Load the bottom "N" models (e.g., "bottom 5").
#   "ALL SD15 MODELS" - All Stable Diffusion 1.5 models.
#   "ALL SD21 MODELS" - All Stable Diffusion 2.0/2.1 models.
#   "ALL SDXL MODELS" - All Stable Diffusion XL models.
#   "ALL INPAINTING MODELS" - All models marked for inpainting.
#   "ALL SFW MODELS" - All models marked as SFW.
#   "ALL NSFW MODELS" - All models marked as NSFW.
#
# The official model reference (in JSON format) is at https://github.com/Haidra-Org/AI-Horde-image-model-reference/blob/main/stable_diffusion.json.
# The model name must match the name in the model reference or be a magic constant.
# If you use `TOP` or `ALL` load commands, you should set a `civitai_api_token`. See that configuration entry for more information.
#
# SD15 models are generally 1-2GB each, SD21 models are generally 5-37B each, and SDXL models are generally 7B each.
